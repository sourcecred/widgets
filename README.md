A Node.js based set of tools to interpret SourceCred scores and generate widgets.
For example to use in README's or as webpage static assets.

## Example usage

```sh
# 1. Use the main sourcecred's score feature to export scores to a file.
SOURCECRED_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN \
  node PATH_TO_SOURCECRED/bin/sourcecred.js load sourcecred/sourcecred
node PATH_TO_SOURCECRED/bin/sourcecred.js scores sourcecred/sourcecred \
  > scores.json

# 2. Install and build this package.
yarn
yarn -s build

# 3. Generate a contributor wall SVG.
./bin/contributor-wall-svg.js < scores.json > contributors.svg
```

Or using the Docker equivalent of this.

```sh
# 1. Use the main sourcecred image to export scores to a file.
SOURCECRED_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN \
  docker run --rm -ti -v sourcecred_data:/data -e SOURCECRED_GITHUB_TOKEN \
  sourcecred/sourcecred load sourcecred/sourcecred
docker run --rm -ti -v sourcecred_data:/data sourcecred/sourcecred scores \
  sourcecred/sourcecred > scores.json

# 2. To build a Docker image with your changes. Or skip this to use a release from Dockerhub.
docker build -t sourcecred/widgets .

# 3. Generate a contributor wall SVG.
# Note: don't use the -t option here, it will produce an error "the input device is not a TTY".
docker run --rm -i sourcecred/widgets < scores.json > contributors.svg
```
